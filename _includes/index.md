### Programming

I ❤️ Python and use it for 99% of my work.

Check out my personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github}}), e.g.
 - [`nuts`](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github}}/nuts): a Python package for calculating kernels on graphs
 - [`agape`](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github}}/agape): **A**utomatic **G**ene Ontology **a**nnotation **p**rediction in *S. pomb**e*** in Python

I also post on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}), answer questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/{{ site.author.stackoverflow}}) and write [Gists](https://gist.github.com/{{ site.author.github}}) of my ideas.


### Open source

I have contributed a number of pull requests to open source projects, e.g.
 - [Added `to_numpy_array` and `from_numpy_array` functions to NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2522) that convert a `Graph` object to/from an adjacency matrix
 - [Implemented deterministic graph layouts in NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2766) via the `random_state` keyword argument


### Research

I predict the functions of genes using machine learning.

I work on the fission yeast *S. pombe* and want to comprehensively annotate its genome with functions. To do this, I use machine learning to identify patterns in large experimental data sets and predict which [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) terms I think are associated with each gene.
