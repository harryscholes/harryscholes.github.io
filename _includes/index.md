### Programming

I ❤️ Python and use it for 99% of my work.

Check out my personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github}}), e.g.
 - [`nuts`](https://github.com/harryscholes/nuts): a Python package for calculating kernels on graphs
 - [`agape`](https://github.com/harryscholes/agape): **A**utomatic **G**ene Ontology **a**nnotation **p**rediction in S. pomb**e** in Python

Or my [Gists](https://gist.github.com/harryscholes/). Or my answers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/{{ site.author.stackoverflow}}).


### Open source

I have contributed a number of pull requests to open source projects, e.g.
 - [Added `to_numpy_array` and `from_numpy_array` functions to NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2522) that convert a `Graph` object to/from its adjacency matrix
 - [Implemented deterministic graph layouts in NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/2766) via the `random_state` keyword argument


### Research

In my PhD, I want to assign functions to all genes in the fission yeast *S. pombe*. To do this, I use machine learning to learn patterns of genes in large data sets and then predict which [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) terms are associated with each gene.
